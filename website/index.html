<h1>Welcome to my personal space</h1>
<p>This self-hosted webpage is brought to you by the power of light &#9728;&#65039;!</p>
<p>
    Run on the Wemos D1 Mini v2.2.0 (utilizing the ESP8266 chip), powered by a 10W solar panel, with 1900mAh battery for
    storing the gathered energy, this is truly a self-sufficient solution intended to minimize the carbon footprint of
    the modern technology.

<h1>About me</h1>

</ul>
<p>
    My name is Piotr Waszkiewicz (male, pronouns: he/his), and I've been interested in modern technology from the
    earliest days.
</p>
<p>
    My passion for computers started in second grade of primary school when I got my first PC. Since then, I've been
    broadening my knowledge and skills set by first learning photo and video edition, attending classes held by
    House of Culture in my local neighbourhood. It didn't take long before I realized that I'd like to become
    a programmer, and so here I am - a software developer astonished by the amount of knowledge I'm still lacking!
</p>

<h2>Education and work experience</h2>
<p>
    In 2017 I graduated from Warsaw University of Technology, Faculty of Mathematics and Information Sciences with
    master's degree in artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
    Immediately after graduation I've started working for my first company, and after changing my employees several
    times I'm as passionate about programming as ever.
</p>

        If you are interested in all details regarding my employment don't hesitate to take a look at my CV:

        </a>
    </i>
</p>

<h2>Programming experience</h2>
<p><i>I won't lie that I'm a full-stack developer. I'm certainly not, despite my desire to be that good.</i></p>
<p>
    I'm mainly a Python <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">backend developer</span> enthusiast with some
    knowledge regarding devops and frontend development (check my CV for more details).
</p>
<p>
    I try to maintain high code health via usage of external tools for type checking (MyPy), code style (Flake8) and
    full test coverage.
</p>
<p>
    I prefer to use object-oriented programming approach where possible as in my opinion it's easier to read and
    understand.
</p>
<p>
    I have strong drive to write generic code that can be easily extended with new features.
</p>
<p>
    I hate copy-paste code and refactor it whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
    I like to use long descriptive names for the variables and functions and avoid any abbreviations.
</p>
<p>
    I try to refrain from writing code comments apart from docstrings, as I believe they get outdated too fast.
</p>

<h2>Work culture</h2>
<p>
    When it comes to work I believe that a good communication is a key to success. I think that most of the problems
    regarding software not meeting the needs of a client are caused by the lack of proper discussion and not enough
    willingness to understand each other. It's much easier for me to work when as much information regarding the
    requirements is available prior to starting development. I try to write down all of those in form of
    "acceptance criteria" and ensure that they are thoroughly tested before marking my job as done.
</p>
<p>
    Personally I'm a huge fan of the SCRUM methodology - it naturally fits my way of thinking about software
    development. I like taking parts in discussions that try to refine the process of managing the project. I really
    like dividing huge tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. I prefer daily commits to huge features that take
    weeks to finish. I despise checking huge PRs with multiple changes unrelated to each other. I'm always eager
    for some pair programming - in my experience this helps tremendously with unloading the bus factor, and usually
    results in a better code written.
</p>
<p>
    I believe that in order to get the best team performance people need to get to know each other. Integration trips,
    or any other activities encouraging exchange of views (not necessarily related to work) are a great way of
    maintaining healthy relations between team members.
</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
    Apart from programming (or technology in general) I have several other interests. In no particular order those
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>triops</b> - small crustaceans that I keep in my aquarium. I used to have a website about those fascinating
        prehistoric creatures. Maybe I'll recreate it sometime.</li>
    <li><b>DYI keyboard</b> - since keyboard is one of the main tools used for my work, I've decided to build my own.
        I got hooked, and now I have more than one. Mostly using Niu Mini 40% though.</li>
    <li><b>FPV drones</b> - always liked RC toys. Drones provide me the best amount of adrenaline and fun.</li>
    <li><b>aquaristics</b> - I focus mostly on aquascaping since I don't have a room for huge aquarium to keep all
        those interesting fish...</li>
    <li><b>carnivorous plants</b> - my favourite type of plants. I keep different types of drosera, sarracenia,
        nepenthes, as well as a cephalotus and flytraps.</li>
</ul>
