Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Piotr Waszkiewicz.

I'm a software engineer located in Poland.

### CV

If you are interested in my work experience take a look at my CV in the repo: 
[CV_2022_eng.pdf](CV_2022_eng.pdf). 

### Website

I invite all of those wanting to get to know me better to my personal website available at
[piotr-waszkiewicz.net](http://piotr-waszkiewicz.net).

*Please note that it is hosted on what is intended to be a self-sustainable solution: a small 
ESP8266 chip connected to a battery and solar panel. It may be possible that the battery has run dry
and there's no sun to charge it. In case of website unavailability try again at a later date.*
